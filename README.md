# FacadeDesignPattern
LLD for Facade Design Pattern

As the name suggests, this pattern hides the complexities of a system from the client, providing instead a simple/attractive interface. The main advantage for developers comes through making complex software libraries or frameworks easier to understand and access. It can also isolate ‘outside’ code from the complex internal systems.

For example - Handling drawing of different shapes by using one Facade class or interface.
